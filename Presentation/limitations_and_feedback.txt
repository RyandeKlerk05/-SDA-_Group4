-- Limitations: --
For Sub-questions 1 and 2, the final results only show a relatively moderate negative relation from the Spearman correlation, this is possibly due to the used dataset being relatively unbalanced in the distribution of ages, consisting of a very large group of younger people (~70%), which might have impacted the data, especially the Spearman, since having many people in the same age group, means more ties when ranking the data, and thus the calculation being a bit less accurate, So using a more evenly distributed dataset in the future would possibly be better.
For sub-question three, we did not take regional differences into serious consideration. For example, high-income countries tend to have more psychiatrists and higher rates of access to medical care, while people in lower-income regions often face limited mental health resources. Similarly, people in culturally conservative areas may be more likely to avoid seeking mental health treatment. These differences would lead to an underestimation of mental disorder prevalence in some regions.

The results for the fourth sub-question should be carefully analysed, as it might be affected by a limited dataset for mental health changes; the dataset consists of 152 countries. Future research could attempt to expand these datasets to replicate the experiment. Another limitation is that our team does not explicitly take other factors that could affect mental health (e.g., financial issues, war) into account. To make a more reliable conclusion on the effects of social media usage on mental health, future research should take other factors that could affect mental health more explicitly into account. 

-- Struggles: --
In subquestion three, we faced a challenge in continent analysis. The social media share dataset do not offer official names for some countries, which made it difficult to accurately map country names to continents. Another challenge was duplicate names. Some geographical entities are listed as regions rather than countries, and the same name can appear on different continents.Because of the two challenges，some data were missing from the final dataset, which might have reduced the accuracy of our analysis.

The primary challenge in implementing sub-question 4 was the implementation of the web scraping process. This sub-question required web scraping data from over 200 countries, each using different URL formats. Some countries underwent a name change (e.g., Swaziland became Eswatini in 2018). Therefore, the team had to manually ensure that data from every country would not appear multiple times in the final dataset.

-- Feedback on Presentation: --
After the presentation, our team got some interesting feedback about our dataset on mental health. One of our peers questioned whether our dataset on mental health takes the stigma around mental health or the different definitions of mental health issues within different cultures into account. Our study uses a dataset from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME). Although our team understood the diverse procedures IHME uses to collect data, our team did not investigate whether the IHME dataset takes different definitions of mental health disorders and cultural stigmas around mental health into account. This feedback addresses a limitation in definitions in our study.
